LecApi - Timetable Scheduling for FIT CTU
Author: Gehrman Sparrow

LecApi is a Python library designed for timetable scheduling, specifically tailored for the Faculty of Information Technology (FIT) at Czech Technical University (CTU). This library allows users to plan their course schedules by providing an interactive interface for entering course codes, selecting semesters, and generating conflict-free timetables.

Features
Timetable Generation: Automatically generates schedules based on course availability and user-selected criteria.
Conflict Resolution: The system ensures that no two courses are scheduled at the same time.
Customizable Criteria: Users can define their preferred criteria (e.g., course conflicts, course distribution) to guide the timetable generation process.
Interactive Interface: The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the timetable generation process.
Error Handling: The library provides error handling for scenarios where no valid timetable can be generated.
